# NodeJS-Code

You can find the material/code in my this repository related to javascript. The code is organized by lectures, starting from lecture 1 to the last lecture. In lecture 1, I've included several files that demonstrate important programming concepts in JavaScript, such as async/await, callbacks, and promises.

1) The "callback.js" file demonstrates how to use callback functions. However, since using too many nested callbacks can lead to a problem known as "callback hell", the solution of callback hell is promises.
2) In the "promise.js" file, I've shown how to use promises in order to avoid "callback hell" problem. 
3) The "asyn.js" file shows how to use async and await and their usage. I've also included an example of using promises in this file.
4) The "example.js" file illustrates how to use async/await to handle tasks that depend on other tasks, as well as independent tasks.
5) Finally, the "index.js" file combines all the codes from mentioned above files.
